Given a singly linked list, we need to arrange the consonants and vowel nodes of it in such a way that all the vowel nodes come before the consonants while maintaining the order of their arrival.

Examples: 

Input : a -> b -> c -> e -> d -> 
        o -> x -> i
Output : a -> e -> o -> i -> b -> 
         c -> d -> x
