O(m+n) and O(1) using two pointer gap method

Assume the gap as (m+n)/2 initially
Take as a pointer1 = 0 and pointer2 = gap.
Run a inner loop from pointer1 &  pointer2 to  m+n and whenever arr[pointer2]<arr[pointer1], just swap those.
After completion of the loop reduce the gap as Math.ceil(gap/2.0)
Repeat the process until gap>0.
