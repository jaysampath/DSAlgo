You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example 3:

Input: matrix = [[1]]
Output: [[1]]
Example 4:

Input: matrix = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [[3,1],[4,2]]
 

Constraints:

matrix.length == n
matrix[i].length == n
1 <= n <= 20
-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000
